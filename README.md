# MLFantasyFootballClustering

The goal of this project was to learn how fantasy sports platforms such as fantasypros, ESPN's IBM Watson, NFL Fantasy, utilize ML models to create "Player Tiers" for predicting how much statistical output an athlete is capable of producing. <br>

These code files are in MATLAB, so please download the mlx files to view my results! <br>

Feel free compare my cluster results with my PDF files containing consensus (ECR) tiers created by FantasyPros analysts. Please note that my clusters will only include the projected Top 50 players at each respective position due to computation time.
