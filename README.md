# MLFantasyFootballClustering

The goal of this project was to learn how fantasy sports platforms such as fantasypros, ESPN's IBM Watson, NFL Fantasy, utilize ML models to create "Player Tiers" for predicting how much statistical output an athlete is capable of producing. <br>

These code files are in MATLAB, so please download them to view the results! <br>

Please compare my cluster results with my provided tier screenshots from FantasyPros.
